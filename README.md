# Database-Systems
This repository take a look at the architecture and design of modern database management systems. Database management systems (DBMS) are widely used to manage, store and query diverse datasets, and have become an invaluable tool in today's enterprises and large web companies. Their applications include transaction processing, business intelligence and analytics. We will study topics such as query processing algorithms and data structures, data organization and storage, query optimization and cost modeling, transaction management and concurrency control, high-availability mechanisms, parallel and distributed databases, and a survey of modern architectures including NoSQL, column-oriented and streaming databases.
